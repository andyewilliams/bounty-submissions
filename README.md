# ðŸ§  Welcome to the Adaptive Intelligence Bounty Challenge

This bounty campaign invites you to:

- Investigate real-world domains where adaptive intelligence is missing.
- Apply the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) to diagnose systemic failure points.
- Use open-source simulations to model how and why good ideas are structurally filtered out.
- Submit recursive solutions â€” self-improving and self-modeling processes â€” to help build resilience.

## How To Participate

1. **Pick a Domain:** Climate change, AI alignment, biosecurity, governance, etc.
2. **Use Simulations:** Try running scenarios using our Idea Filtering or Failure Modes simulations (optional but encouraged).
3. **Write Up Findings:** Follow the bounty template.
4. **Submit via GitHub Pull Request:** Fork this repo and open a PR.
5. **Iterate and Improve:** Respond to feedback from the community.

**Your Insight Can Save Civilization.**

**Important:**  
This campaign and all associated documents â€” including the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) theorem and framework â€” were collaboratively generated with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs).  
We explicitly invite human experts to test, critique, and attempt to falsify every element presented.
